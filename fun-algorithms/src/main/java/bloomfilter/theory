Bloom filter

A bloom filter : Used in places where we want to determine if a particular element belongs to a 
set or not. Bloom filter can have false positives but it cannot have false negatives. It means 
the element MAY be present in the set. But it can definitely say that the element is not present 
in the particular set.

Working : 
1. It uses a large array of 0's and 1's
2. All are initialized to 0
3. It uses K hash functions which procduce value in between 0-n : n - size of array
4. For every element the hash are computed for every hash function and the corres-
   ponding entries in the array are set to one.
5. To check if element is present in the set. The hashes are computed
   if(all bits are set)
   	 then the element MIGHT be present in set
   else
     the element is definitely not in the set
